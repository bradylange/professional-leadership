===============================================================================
Project Outline:
===============================================================================
February 13, 2019: 
- Save the postings
- Scan the postings and grab leadership/lead related words
  1.) Grab the full sentence/bullet item
  2.) Get the key words from 1
- Find some papers about the words distance, define model
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

March 13, 2019:
- Run scraping algorithm each day for two weeks with filter set
  to 'within the last day' to grab each days leadership related
  postings
- Methods:
  1.) Gensim - Word2Vec [New method - machine learning]
  2.) TF-IDF (base-like model) [Older method]
- Gain better understanding of methods:
  Gensim – Word2Vec: https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html
  Word Embedding: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/06/

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  
May 5, 2019:
- Send unique job titles to Dr. Dai
- Word2Vec: the closest words to “leadership” and “management” and related 
  words to “retail leadership” and “manufacture leadership” were displayed to
  Dr. Zheng.
- Next, Dr. Zheng will think about the detailed questions using these initial 
  results and let us extract data. If she needs some initial results from me,
  she will send email to me.
- Keep grabbing the job postings and break the job postings to sentences. 
- Use one csv file for one-week data and put the date information in files’ 
  name. 
- For the past data, add the date information in files’ name.        
- Organizing files by date will help us to do trend research in the future.
- Analyze and explain the results from tf-idf. The main question is what 
  relationships/conclusion did I find/discover from the tf-idf results. 
  I could think about and write down anything I get. 
- After Dr. Zheng gives questions lists, we check whether what you found could 
  answer her questions. If not, more analysis will be done and more explanations 
  will be added into this documents.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
May 8, 2019:
- Buy machine learning book, learn more about machine learning
- Analyze current data to find trends, etc. and explain the data (give meaning)
- Scrape jobs everyday for a month and combine data into one file by week
- Add industry variable to data set (Indeed.com doesn't allow this)
- Stage 2: Scrape jobs from LinkedIn.com and employees/employers leadership
  definition/experience 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

May 15, 2019:
1.) 
Classify job posting data by function. Function classification:
- General Management
- CEO (if such job posting available)
- Sales and Marketing
- Information Technology
- Accounting and Finance
- Human Resources
- Operations
- Strategy (if applicable)
- Partner (if applicable)
- Legal (if applicable)
- Research and Development
The job title or job description may have such functional area information. We 
hope to have separate folders for job postings from different functional areas. 
Then we could use statistics/machine learning to explore "leadership" definition 
in these functional areas.

2.)
Classify job posting data by industry. Industry classification: 
https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/sic_manual.html
(only for the first level classification, A, B, C, D, .) I think it need to 
check the company's information and does not directly show in the job postings. 
You decide whether it is too hard to get this classification or not technically. 
Let me know whether we could do this or not during the summer.
 
3.)
Classify job posting data by "Experience Level".  In the Indeed website, it 
could list jobs according to different Experience Level. After I typed keyword 
"leader", I got the following list. And from the following screenshot. You could 
see "Experience Level" (Entry level, Mid level, Senior level) in the bottom 
right side. Is it possible to classify the job posting data according to 
experience level? I do not mean to classify the historical data, it may be 
difficult because there is no such information in job postings. This information
is provided by HRs when they posted a job. I mean is it possible to directly 
collect leadership-related job postings separately from these three categories. 
The following research question we will study is to check whether the 
classification of leadership-related job positions (from Indeed) is consistent 
with the theoretical leadership levels. Please let me know your thoughts.
 
4.)
Dr. Zheng wants to get some sample leadership-related job postings from the same 
company, such as 3M, United Health, Wells Fargo, etc. Could you do some simple 
search on job postings to get some? Do not need too many. If you could find 5-10 
postings from 3-5 companies, that will be enough.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

September 9, 2019:
There are two tasks in the next step:
1.)
Run tf-idf on old data and combined data (old + new) to find the closest 
words (20 should be enough) to leadership (leader, lead, etc.) and 
management (manager, manage, etc.)

2.)
Extract sentences in which management related words and leadership related 
words appear together. After that, we will do some NLP analysis on those 
sentences. 

We will meet on Wednesday (9/25) at 1:50 pm in two weeks. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

September 12, 2019
Possible research questions:
1. Are words close to leadership and those close to management different?
2. What factors predict the differences? Why are they different?
3. What’s the impact of the differences?
4. When are management and leadership appear together? When they do, how do 
   they differentiate or relate?
5. Do jobs titled leader/leadership differ from jobs titled manager/management? 
   If so, how are they different?
 
Next steps:
1. Add data to see whether job ads describe lead and manage differently? Are 
   similar words used that are associated with lead and manage across different 
   samples? 
   Are there sufficient differences between words close to lead and words close 
   to manage? (Ruxin)
2. Develop a prospectus describing project ideas and get feedback from relevant 
   experts at the Academy of Management conference. (Wei)
